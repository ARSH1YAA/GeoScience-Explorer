# 🌍 GeoScience Explorer

**GeoScience Explorer** is an interactive web application that combines geolocation with scientific data from various public APIs. It allows users to discover science-related landmarks, historical events, and environmental data based on their location or any coordinates worldwide.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Here's a breakdown of the **workflow** inside GeoScience Explorer:

### 1. **Location Input**  
Users can either:  
- Click “Use My Current Location” to auto-detect their position using the Geolocation API, or  
- Manually enter a city name or lat/lon coordinates.

### 2. **Fetching Nearby Scientific Sites**  
- The app calls the [Wikipedia GeoSearch API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Geosearch) using the selected coordinates.  
- It filters results to highlight **scientific or historical significance**.

### 3. **Data Enrichment**  
For each result:  
- The [Wikipedia REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/) fetches a brief summary, image, and URL.  
- Optionally, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access) enhances the data with structured metadata (e.g., dates, entity types).

### 4. **Rendering on the Map**  
- Results are mapped using **Leaflet + React Leaflet**, with popups for summaries and quick links.

### 5. **Live Weather Info**  
- Current weather for the selected coordinates is retrieved from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and displayed with icons.

### 6. **Planned: Time Capsules**  
- Users will be able to drop digital messages (text/images) on the map at specific coordinates.  
- Capsules can be rediscovered by others exploring the same place.
